title: 8085 Program to Multiply Two 8-bit Numbers
description: An 8085 assembly program that multiplies two unsigned 8-bit numbers from memory using repeated addition and stores the 16-bit result in consecutive memory locations.
---

import AdBlock from "../../../../../components/AdBlock.astro";

Write an 8085 program that reads two 8-bit numbers from memory (e.g., `2500H` and `2501H`), multiplies them by **repeated addition**, and stores the 16-bit product across two bytes in memory (e.g., `3000H`-`3001H`).

This approach is straightforward and avoids indirect multiplication or shift-based algorithms, making it easy to follow and educational.

## ⚡ TL;DR — Final Working Code

```asm
        ; Interface
        FIRST_NUM_ADDR   EQU 2500H
        SECOND_NUM_ADDR  EQU 2501H
        RESULT_ADDR      EQU 3000H

        ; Step 1: Load inputs
        LXI H, FIRST_NUM_ADDR
        MOV B, M             ; B ← multiplicand
        INX H
        MOV C, M             ; C ← multiplier

        ; Step 2: Initialize result
        LXI H, 0000H         ; HL ← result (16-bit accumulator)

        ; Step 3: Multiply using repeated addition
MUL_LOOP:
        MOV A, L
        ADD B
        MOV L, A
        JNC SKIP_INC
        INR H                ; Carry to high byte

SKIP_INC:
        DCR C
        JNZ MUL_LOOP

        ; Step 4: Store result
        LXI D, RESULT_ADDR
        MOV M, L             ; Store low byte
        INX D
        MOV M, H             ; Store high byte
        HLT
```

## 🧱 Step 1: Define the Interface and Load Inputs

First, define where your inputs come from and where the result will go:

| Address | Purpose                 |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| `2500H` | First 8‑bit operand     |
| `2501H` | Second 8‑bit operand    |
| `3000H` | Product low byte (LSB)  |
| `3001H` | Product high byte (MSB) |

Next, begin by loading the two operands into registers for processing:

```asm
LXI H, 2500H     ; HL → first operand
MOV B, M         ; B ← first number
INX H            ; HL → second operand
MOV C, M         ; C ← second number
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

Initialize memory:

```
2500H = 05H
2501H = 03H
```

After loading:

* Register B = `05H`
* Register C = `03H`

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Initialize Result Registers

We’ll now prepare registers to **hold the result** of multiplication.

Since multiplying two 8-bit numbers can produce a 16-bit result (maximum `255 × 255 = 65025` = `FE01H`), we need:

* One register for the **low byte** (e.g., `L`)
* One for the **high byte** (e.g., `H`)
* An additional register (`C`) will act as a loop counter (already holds one multiplier)

---

### 🧠 What We're Doing

* Clear the result registers (HL pair) to start from zero
* Use `C` as the counter to add the multiplicand (`B`) repeatedly

---

### 🧾 Code (Initialize Result)

```asm
LXI H, 0000H     ; HL ← 0000H → result = 0
                 ; B = multiplicand, C = multiplier
```

Now we’re ready to perform the actual multiplication in the next step using **repeated addition with carry** into HL.

## 🧱 Step 3: Add the Multiplicand Repeatedly

Now we’ll perform the multiplication using **repeated addition**.

Since register `C` holds the multiplier, we’ll add the multiplicand (`B`) to the result (`HL`) that many times. To properly handle 16-bit accumulation, we’ll add `B` to the **L register**, and propagate any carry into **H**.

---

### 🧠 What We're Doing

* Loop `C` times:

  * Add `B` to `L` (low byte)
  * If there’s a carry, increment `H` (high byte)
* Decrement `C` until zero

---

### 🧾 Code (Multiplication Loop)

```asm
MUL_LOOP:
    MOV A, L       ; A ← current low byte
    ADD B          ; A ← A + multiplicand
    MOV L, A       ; Store updated low byte

    JNC SKIP_INC   ; If no carry, skip
    INR H          ; Else, increment high byte

SKIP_INC:
    DCR C          ; Decrement loop counter
    JNZ MUL_LOOP   ; Repeat if C ≠ 0
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

If:

* B = 5 (multiplicand)
* C = 3 (multiplier)

Then:

* HL = `000F` (15 decimal), as expected for `5 × 3`

Now we're ready to store the result in memory in the next step.

---

## 🧱 Step 4: Store the 16-bit Result in Memory

After computing the result in the HL register pair:

* `L` holds the **lower byte** of the product
* `H` holds the **upper byte** (in case of overflow)

Now we need to store both bytes at predefined memory addresses for output.

---

### 📦 Output Mapping

| Address | Purpose              |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| `3000H` | Low byte of product  |
| `3001H` | High byte of product |

---

### 🧾 Code (Store Result)

```asm
LXI D, 3000H     ; DE → destination address
MOV M, L         ; Store low byte at 3000H
INX H            ; Move to 3001H
MOV M, H         ; Store high byte
HLT
```

> 🔍 Note: If `HL` was used earlier, use another register pair (like `DE`) for storing, or reload address.

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

For:

```
2500H = 0AH  (10)
2501H = 0CH  (12)
```

After execution:

```
3000H = 78H  ; LSB = 120
3001H = 00H  ; MSB = 0
```

This confirms the product `10 × 12 = 120` is stored correctly.

## 📚 Summary

This program multiplies two unsigned 8-bit numbers using **repeated addition**, a common approach on processors like the 8085 which lack a dedicated `MUL` instruction.

It demonstrates:

✅ Careful setup of an input/output interface
✅ Use of HL as a **16-bit accumulator**
✅ Proper handling of **carry** across bytes
✅ Clean final result storage in memory

The method is simple, reliable, and teaches how arithmetic operations are built from basic instructions in low-level programming.
