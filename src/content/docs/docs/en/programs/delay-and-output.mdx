title: 8085 Program for Delay Loop and Output to Port
description: Learn how to use delay loops and the OUT instruction in 8085 to send values to output ports with visible timing gaps. Useful for LED blink and pattern generation.
---

import AdBlock from "../../../../../components/AdBlock.astro";

Write an 8085 assembly program that:

* Sends a value (`55H`) to output port `01H`
* Waits using a software delay loop
* Repeats this pattern indefinitely

## ⚡ TL;DR — Final Working Code

```asm
START:  MVI A, 55H        ; Value to send
        OUT 01H           ; Output to port

        MVI B, 0AH        ; Outer loop counter
DELAY_OUTER:
        MVI C, 0FFH       ; Inner loop counter
DELAY_INNER:
        DCR C
        JNZ DELAY_INNER
        DCR B
        JNZ DELAY_OUTER

        JMP START         ; Repeat forever
```

### 💡 In Sim8085:

> ✅ **Turn on “Simulate Instruction Timing”** to observe the delay effect visibly.

Let me know if you want to:

* ✅ Start the next article: *Count Number of 1’s in a Byte*
* 🧪 Add optional exercises for this one (e.g., toggling output, adding input polling)

## 🧱 Step 1: Define the Interface

Before writing instructions, we need to answer:

> **How does this program interact with the world?**

We define a **hardware interface** now — not just memory.

---

### 📦 Interface Details

| Component  | Meaning                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `OUT 01H`  | Output value to port `01H`             |
| Delay loop | Approximate timing using software loop |

We assume:

* The device connected to port `01H` can accept simple 8-bit values
* No handshaking or status check — fire-and-forget model

---

### 🧾 Code (Basic I/O Only)

We’ll begin by just sending a value to the port.

```asm
MVI A, 55H     ; Load value
OUT 01H        ; Send to output port
HLT            ; Stop here for now
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test

* Check if port `01H` receives `55H`
* In a simulator: port log or memory-mapped device will show this
* On hardware: LED pattern may show (if connected)

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Add a Delay Loop

After sending data to the output port, we want the program to **wait** for a visible duration. Without delay, the change is too fast for humans (or some devices) to notice.

---

### 🧠 Why Delay?

* Human eyes can't catch microsecond-level changes
* Simulators and hardware might register output, but it's not **observable**
* We use a **software delay loop** to create a visible pause using CPU cycles

---

### 💡 What We’re Doing

* Use two registers (`B` and `C`) to build a **nested loop**
* Each iteration consumes CPU time
* No memory or port changes — just cycles

---

### 🧾 Code with Delay Loop

```asm
MVI A, 55H        ; Load value
OUT 01H           ; Output to port

MVI B, 0AH        ; Outer loop counter
DELAY_OUTER:
    MVI C, 0FFH   ; Inner loop counter
DELAY_INNER:
    DCR C
    JNZ DELAY_INNER
    DCR B
    JNZ DELAY_OUTER

HLT               ; Stop after delay
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test (Sim8085 Tip 💡)

To **observe the delay visually in Sim8085**:

> 🔧 Enable the setting: **Simulate Instruction Timing**

This makes Sim8085 account for the actual instruction execution delays — so your delay loops behave realistically and visibly slow the output.

---

### ⚙️ Why Two Loops?

* `C` counts down from `FFH` (255 times)
* `B` counts outer passes (10 times)
* Total delay = 255 × 10 instructions

Feel free to tweak `B` and `C` to control timing.

## 🧱 Step 3: Loop the Pattern Forever

So far, our program:

* Sends one value to the port
* Waits using a delay loop
* Halts

Now we want it to:

> **Repeat this output–delay cycle forever**, without halting.

This is common in:

* LED blink programs
* Periodic buzzer beeps
* Scrolling or toggling displays

---

### 🧠 Why Loop Forever?

* Real-world output programs often run until powered off
* They wait, act, and repeat — **no explicit halt**
* This is also useful for practicing infinite loops and timing control

---

### 💡 What We’re Doing

* Wrap the entire output + delay logic inside a loop
* Jump back to the top once the delay finishes

---

### 🧾 Full Code: Repeating Output with Delay

```asm
START:  MVI A, 55H        ; Value to output
        OUT 01H           ; Send to port

        MVI B, 0AH        ; Outer delay loop
DELAY_OUTER:
        MVI C, 0FFH       ; Inner delay loop
DELAY_INNER:
        DCR C
        JNZ DELAY_INNER
        DCR B
        JNZ DELAY_OUTER

        JMP START         ; Repeat forever
```

---

### 🧪 Manual Test (Sim8085)

1. Turn on **Simulate Instruction Timing**
2. Use Sim8085’s **I/O port log** or a connected visualization (LED or register view)
3. You’ll see port `01H` receive `55H`, hold it briefly, and repeat — with CPU visibly in delay

---

### 🔁 Bonus: Modify the Output Each Time

Later, try toggling values (e.g., `55H` → `AAH` alternately) to simulate blinking or toggling.

We can add that as a separate step if desired.

## 📚 Summary

This problem shifts focus from data processing to **hardware interaction and timing**.

It teaches:

* How to write to **output ports** with `OUT`
* How to build **delay loops** using registers and CPU cycles
* The role of **infinite loops** in embedded programs
* How to **simulate hardware behavior** in a tool like Sim8085

This type of pattern forms the foundation of real-world behaviors like:

* Blinking LEDs
* Buzzer timers
* Signal pattern generators
* Debouncing inputs or polling peripherals
